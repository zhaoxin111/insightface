## Partial-FC
Partial FC is a distributed deep learning training framework for face recognition. The goal of Partial FC is to facilitate large-scale classification task (e.g. 10 or 100 million identities). It is much faster than the model parallel solution and there is no performance drop.

## Glint360K
We clean, merge, and release the largest and cleanest face recognition dataset Glint360K, 
which contains **`17091657`** images of **`360232`** individuals. 
By employing the Patial FC training strategy, baseline models trained on Glint360K can easily achieve state-of-the-art performance. 
Detailed evaluation results on the large-scale test set (e.g. IFRT, IJB-C and Megaface) are as follows:

#### Evaluation on IFRT       
**`r`** denotes the sampling rate of negative class centers.
| Backbone     | Dataset            | African | Caucasian | Indian | Asian | ALL   |
| ------------ | -----------        | ----- | ----- | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| R50          | MS1M-V3            | 76.24 | 86.21 | 84.44  | 37.43 | 71.02 |
| R124         | MS1M-V3            | 81.08 | 89.06 | 87.53  | 38.40 | 74.76 |
| R100         | **Glint360k**(r=1.0)   | 89.50 | 94.23 | 93.54  | **65.07** | **88.67** |
| R100         | **Glint360k**(r=0.1)   | **90.45** | **94.60** | **93.96**  | 63.91 | 88.23 |

#### Evaluation on IJB-C and Megaface  
We employ ResNet100 as the backbone and CosFace (m=0.4) as the loss function.
TAR@FAR=1e-4 is reported on the IJB-C datasets, and TAR@FAR=1e-6 is reported on the Megaface dataset.
|Test Dataset        | IJB-C     | Megaface_Id  | Megaface_Ver |
| :---               | :---:     | :---:        | :---:        |
| MS1MV2             | 96.4      | 98.3         | 98.6         |
|**Glint360k** | **97.3**  | **99.1**     | **99.1**     |

## Performance
We neglect the influence of IO. All experiments use mixed-precision training, and the backbone is ResNet50.

## FAQ
#### Glint360K's Face Alignment Settings?
We use a same alignment setting with MS1MV2, code is [here](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/issues/1286).

#### Why update Glint360K, is there a bug in the previous version?  
In the previous version of Glint360K, there is no bug when using softmax training, but there is a bug in triplet training. 
In the latest Glint360k, this bug has been fixed.

#### Dataset in Google Drive or Dropbox?
The torrent will be release soon.
