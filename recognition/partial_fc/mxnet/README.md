## Train
#### Requirements
python==3.6  
cuda==10.1    
cudnn==765    
mxnet-cu101==1.6.0.post0  
pip install easydict mxboard opencv-python tqdm    
[nccl](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/install-guide/index.html)  
[openmpi](mxnet/setup-utils/install-mpi.sh)==4.0.0  
[horovod](mxnet/setup-utils/install-horovod.sh)==0.19.2  

#### Failures due to SSH issues
The host where horovodrun is executed must be able to SSH to all other hosts without any prompts.

#### Run with horovodrun
Typically one GPU will be allocated per process, so if a server has 8 GPUs, you will run 8 processes. 
In horovodrun, the number of processes is specified with the -np flag.

To run on a machine with 8 GPUs:
```shell script
horovodrun -np 8 -H localhost:8 bash config.sh
```

To run on two machine with 16 GPUs:
```shell script
horovodrun -np 16 -H ip1:8,ip2:8 bash config.sh
```

#### Run with mpi
```shell script
bash run.sh
```
